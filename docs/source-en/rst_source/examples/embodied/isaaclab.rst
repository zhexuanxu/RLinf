This example provides a comprehensive guide to using the **RLinf** framework in the `IsaacLab <https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/lab>`_ environment
to finetune gr00t algorithms through reinforcement learning. It covers the entire process—from environment setup and core algorithm design to training configuration, evaluation, and visualization—along with reproducible commands and configuration snippets.

The primary objective is to develop a model capable of performing robotic manipulation:

1. **Visual Understanding**: Processing RGB images from the robot's camera.
2. **Language Comprehension**: Interpreting natural-language task descriptions.
3. **Action Generation**: Producing precise robotic actions (position, rotation, gripper control).
4. **Reinforcement Learning**: Optimizing the policy via PPO with environment feedback.

Environment
-----------

**IsaacLab Environment**

IsaacLab serves as a highly customizable simulation platform that allows users to create custom environments and tasks. 
This example uses a custom RLinf environment `Isaac-Stack-Cube-Franka-IK-Rel-Visuomotor-Rewarded-v0` for reinforcement learning training. To include this custom environment, please follow the **Dependency Installation** section to configure the environment; this environment has already been integrated in the IsaacLab library from the RLinf source by default.

- **Environment**: IsaacLab simulation platform
- **Task**: Control the Franka robot arm to stack cubes in blue, red, and green order (from bottom to top)
- **Observation**: RGB images from third-person camera and robot wrist camera
- **Action Space**: 7-dimensional continuous actions
  - 3D position control (x, y, z)
  - 3D rotation control (roll, pitch, yaw)
  - Gripper control (open/close)

**Task Description**

.. code-block:: text

   Stack the red block on the blue block, then stack the green block on the red block.

**Data Structure**

- **Images**: RGB tensors from main view and wrist view ``[batch_size, H, W, 3]`` (with ``H`` and ``W`` set by the camera resolution in the environment config, e.g., 256x256 in ``examples/embodiment/config/env/isaaclab_stack_cube.yaml``)
- **Task Descriptions**: Natural language instructions
- **State**: End-effector position, orientation, and gripper state
- **Reward**: 0-1 Sparse success/failure reward

**Adding Custom Tasks**

If you want to add custom tasks, you may need to follow these three steps:

1. **Customize IsaacLab Environment**: Refer to `IsaacLab-Examples <https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/v2.3.0/source/overview/environments.html>`__ for available environments. For custom environment setup, refer to `IsaacLab-Quickstart <https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/v2.3.0/source/overview/own-project/index.html>`__.
2. **Configure Training Environment in RLinf**: Refer to `RLinf/rlinf/envs/isaaclab/tasks/stack_cube.py`, place your custom script in `RLinf/rlinf/envs/isaaclab/tasks`, and add relevant code in `RLinf/rlinf/envs/isaaclab/__init__.py`
3. **Configure Task ID**: Refer to ``examples/embodiment/config/env/isaaclab_stack_cube.yaml``, and modify the `init_params.id` parameter to your custom IsaacLab task ID. Ensure that the `defaults` section at the beginning of ``examples/embodiment/config/isaaclab_franka_stack_cube_ppo_gr00t.yaml`` references the correct environment configuration defaults.

Algorithm
--------------

**Core Algorithm Components**

1. **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) (by default)**

   - Advantage estimation using GAE (Generalized Advantage Estimation)

   - Policy clipping with ratio limits

   - Value function clipping

   - Entropy regularization

2. **GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) (untested)**

   - For every state/prompt, the policy generates *G* independent actions
   - Compute the advantage of each action by subtracting the group's mean reward

Isaac Sim Download
--------------------

Before using IsaacLab, you need to download and set up Isaac Sim. Please follow the instructions below:

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir -p isaac_sim
   cd isaac_sim
   wget https://download.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaac-sim-standalone-5.1.0-linux-x86_64.zip
   unzip isaac-sim-standalone-5.1.0-linux-x86_64.zip
   rm isaac-sim-standalone-5.1.0-linux-x86_64.zip

After downloading, set environment variables via:

.. code-block:: bash

   source ./setup_conda_env.sh

.. warning::

   This step must be done every time you open a new terminal to use Isaac Sim.

Model Download
----------------

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /path/to/save/model
   # Download IsaacLab stack_cube few-shot SFT model
   # Method 1: Using git clone
   git lfs install
   git clone https://huggingface.co/RLinf/RLinf-Gr00t-SFT-Stack-cube

   # Method 2: Using huggingface-hub
   # For mainland China users, you can use the following for better download speed:

   pip install huggingface-hub
   hf download RLinf/RLinf-Gr00t-SFT-Stack-cube --local-dir RLinf-Gr00t-SFT-Stack-cube

To enable the model to improve its performance through reinforcement learning, we collected human demonstration data for the ``stack cube`` task in the IsaacLab environment and conducted supervised fine-tuning with **GR00T N1.5** (<https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T/tree/n1.5-release>) as the base model, thereby achieving a baseline task success rate.

The dataset has been open-sourced on HuggingFace: <https://huggingface.co/datasets/RLinf/IsaacLab-Stack-Cube-Data>

Running the Script
------------------

The default configuration file for this example is ``examples/embodiment/config/isaaclab_franka_stack_cube_ppo_gr00t.yaml``. You can modify the configuration file to adjust the training settings, such as GPU allocation, training hyperparameters, and logging options.

**1. Key Cluster Configuration**

You can flexibly configure the GPU count for env, rollout, and actor components.
Additionally, by setting ``pipeline_stage_num = 2`` in the configuration,
you can achieve pipeline overlap between rollout and env, improving rollout efficiency.

.. code:: yaml

   cluster:
      num_nodes: 1
      component_placement:
         env: 0-3
         rollout: 4-7
         actor: 0-7

   rollout:
      pipeline_stage_num: 2

You can also reconfigure the layout to achieve full sharing,
where env, rollout, and actor components all share all GPUs.

.. code:: yaml

   cluster:
      num_nodes: 1
      component_placement:
         env,rollout,actor: all

You can also reconfigure the layout to achieve full separation,
where env, rollout, and actor components each use their own GPUs with no
interference, eliminating the need for offloading functionality.

.. code:: yaml

   cluster:
      num_nodes: 1
      component_placement:
         env: 0-1
         rollout: 2-5
         actor: 6-7


**2. Configure model path**

Update the `model_path` in the configuration file to point to the directory where the model was downloaded.

**3. Launch Commands**

To train gr00t using the PPO algorithm in the IsaacLab environment, run:

.. code:: bash

   bash examples/embodiment/run_embodiment.sh isaaclab_franka_stack_cube_ppo_gr00t

To evaluate gr00t in the IsaacLab environment, run:

.. code:: bash

   bash examples/embodiment/eval_embodiment.sh isaaclab_franka_stack_cube_ppo_gr00t
