This document provides a comprehensive guide to launching and managing 
**Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs)** training tasks within the RLinf framework,
focusing on finetuning a VLA model for robotic manipulation in the RoboTwin environment.

The primary objective is to develop a model capable of performing robotic manipulation by:

1. **Visual Understanding**: Processing RGB images from the robot's camera.
2. **Language Comprehension**: Interpreting natural-language task descriptions.
3. **Action Generation**: Producing precise robotic actions (position, rotation, gripper control).
4. **Reinforcement Learning**: Optimizing the policy via PPO with environment feedback.

Dependency Installation
-----------------------

1. Clone RLinf Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

   # For mainland China users, you can use the following for better download speed:
   # git clone https://ghfast.top/github.com/RLinf/RLinf.git
   git clone https://github.com/RLinf/RLinf.git
   cd RLinf

2. Install Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Option 1: Docker Image**

RLinf provides a pre-configured RoboTwin environment Docker image that includes all required dependencies and can be used directly, **skipping all subsequent installation steps**.

.. code:: bash

   docker run -it --rm --gpus all \
      --shm-size 20g \
      --network host \
      --name rlinf \
      -v .:/workspace/RLinf \
      rlinf/rlinf:agentic-rlinf0.1-robotwin
      # If you need to download the image faster in China, you can use:
      # docker.1ms.run/rlinf/rlinf:agentic-rlinf0.1-robotwin

.. note::
   The Docker image includes:
   
   - RLinf RoboTwin environment dependencies
   - Compatibility patches applied
   - Support for OpenVLA-OFT, OpenPI models

   **After using the Docker image, you can directly proceed to the** `RoboTwin Repository Clone and Assets Download`_ **, ** `Model Download`_ **and** `Running Scripts`_ **sections, skipping all subsequent installation steps.**

**Option 2: Custom Environment**

Install dependencies directly in your environment by running the following command. 
Replace the ``--model openvla-oft`` parameter with the corresponding model name (``openvla-oft`` or ``openpi``) based on the model you want to train:

.. code:: bash

   # To speed up dependency installation in China, you can add `--use-mirror` to the install.sh command below

   bash requirements/install.sh embodied --model openvla-oft --env robotwin
   source .venv/bin/activate

This script will automatically:

- Install RLinf RoboTwin environment dependencies
- Apply RoboTwin compatibility patches (fixing compatibility issues between sapien and mplib)
- Install dependencies for the corresponding VLA model

RoboTwin Repository Clone and Assets Download
---------------------------------------------

RoboTwin Assets are asset files required by the RoboTwin environment and need to be downloaded from HuggingFace.

.. code-block:: bash

   # 1. Clone RoboTwin repository
   git clone https://github.com/RoboTwin-Platform/RoboTwin.git -b RLinf_support
   
   # 2. Download and extract Assets files
   bash script/_download_assets.sh


Model Download
-----------------------

Before starting training, you need to download the corresponding SFT model:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Download the model (choose either method)
   # Method 1: Using git clone
   git lfs install
   git clone https://huggingface.co/RLinf/RLinf-OpenVLAOFT-RoboTwin-SFT-place_empty_cup

   # Method 2: Using huggingface-hub
   # For mainland China users, you can use the following for better download speed:
   # export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
   pip install huggingface-hub
   hf download RLinf/RLinf-OpenVLAOFT-RoboTwin-SFT-place_empty_cup --local-dir RLinf-OpenVLAOFT-RoboTwin-SFT-place_empty_cup

After downloading, ensure that the model path is correctly specified in the configuration yaml file (``actor.model.model_path``).

       num_images_in_input: 1                                                # Number of input images
       num_action_chunks: 25                                                 # Number of action chunks
       unnorm_key: "place_empty_cup"                                         # Action normalization key (must match the unnorm_key used during SFT training)


**2. Environment Configuration**

In the environment configuration file, the following key parameters need to be set:

.. code-block:: yaml

   env/train: robotwin_place_empty_cup
   env/eval: robotwin_place_empty_cup
   
   # In env/train/robotwin_place_empty_cup.yaml:

       collect_wrist_camera: false

**3. Configuration Files**

Using **OpenVLA-OFT** model with **GRPO** algorithm as an example, the corresponding configuration file is:

- **OpenVLA-OFT + GRPO**: ``examples/embodiment/config/robotwin_place_empty_cup_grpo_openvlaoft.yaml``

**4. Launch Command**

After selecting the configuration, run the following command to start training:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   # Set ROBOT_PLATFORM environment variable
   export ROBOT_PLATFORM=ALOHA
   # Set ROBOTWIN_PATH environment variable
   export ROBOTWIN_PATH=/path/to/RoboTwin

   bash examples/embodiment/run_embodiment.sh CHOSEN_CONFIG

For example, training OpenVLA-OFT model with GRPO in the RoboTwin environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Set ROBOT_PLATFORM environment variable
   export ROBOT_PLATFORM=ALOHA
   # Set ROBOTWIN_PATH environment variable
   export ROBOTWIN_PATH=/path/to/RoboTwin

Evaluation Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes how to evaluate different VLA models on the RoboTwin benchmark platform.
In RLinf, model evaluation reuses the same YAML configuration as training.
To switch to evaluation mode, simply set ``runner.only_eval`` to ``True`` in the corresponding YAML file.

1. **OpenVLA-OFT Model Evaluation**

   Please make sure the correct Python virtual environment (venv) is activated before running the commands.  
   If you are using the official Docker image, switch to the ``openvla-oft`` environment via:

   .. code-block:: bash

      source switch_env openvla-oft

   Taking the GRPO algorithm on the ``place_empty_cup`` task as an example, the corresponding configuration file is:

   - ``examples/embodiment/config/robotwin_place_empty_cup_grpo_openvlaoft.yaml``

2. **π₀ Model Evaluation**

   Similarly, ensure that the correct Python virtual environment is activated.  
   If using the official Docker image, switch to the ``openpi`` environment via:

   .. code-block:: bash

      source switch_env openpi

   Taking the GRPO algorithm on the ``place_empty_cup`` task as an example, the corresponding configuration file is:

   - ``examples/embodiment/config/robotwin_place_empty_cup_openpi_eval.yaml``

3. **Enabling Evaluation Mode**

   In either configuration file above, set ``runner.only_eval`` to ``True``:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      runner:
        task_type: embodied
        logger:
          log_path: "../results"
          project_name: rlinf
          experiment_name: "robotwin_grpo_openvlaoft"
          logger_backends: ["tensorboard"]

        max_epochs: 1000
        max_steps: -1
        only_eval: True

   When ``only_eval`` is set to ``True``, the framework runs rollout and evaluation only, without performing parameter updates.

4. **Running Evaluation**

   .. code-block:: bash

      export ROBOT_PLATFORM=ALOHA
      export ROBOTWIN_PATH=/path/to/RoboTwin

      bash examples/embodiment/eval_embodiment.sh CHOSEN_CONFIG

   Replace ``CHOSEN_CONFIG`` with the selected configuration name (without the ``.yaml`` suffix).

5. **Notes**

   - The OpenVLA-OFT model is currently trained and evaluated with the ``[piper, piper, 0.6]`` robot configuration  
   - The π₀ model is currently trained and evaluated with the ``[aloha-agilex]`` robot configuration  
   - For additional configuration details, please refer to the next section **Configuration Details**
